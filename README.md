# Exercism Source Code

### Project Description

This is simply a place to store the code that I write for Exercism problems. I like to have a version control for such things.

### Exercism goal

At first, you start to learn a programming language. What does that mean? You learn the basics, you learn how to make conditionals, loops, etc. I've done that. 

Then you start getting a job where you use these skills. Things look good, as you gain years of experience, but you notice something: you stopped learning. **You stopped growing.**

This is where Exercism comes in. I use exercism to improve my programming skills and improve my skills further. I use Exercism to challenge myself and learn and grow.
